# Security
In this new project I applied the technologies of asp.net for Identity managing.

This project is meant to be illustrative of how asp.net core works, and how it manages http requests. It is important to understand hoy also tag helpers really help
for creating views.

Some future features will be adding more actions to the edition of the identity features and starting to apply the logic for University platform.

Use this repo for your personal knowledge.
